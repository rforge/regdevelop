index: use number <=0 to indicate non-penalized carriers
  names: names of carriers
lasso.terms: 
  1   penalized, 
  -1  non-penalized, 
  0  not included, 
  NA unused
  names: names of terms in model
  first element is always '(Intercept)'. If NA, intercept is not in the
  model
  index == i  corresponds to  lasso.terms[i+1] and attr(index,'term.labels')[i]

problems:

\section{Programming notes}
\Itm
regr: handling of data, subset, weights, ...
is subtile: weights may need to be evaluated before subset is taken.\\
The elimination of unused levels might be deferred to model.frame using the
argument \T{drop.unused.levels} -- 
but some fitting functions (at least \T{survreg}) do not pass the argument
on to it.\\
The component \T{\$allvars} of the \T{regr} result is good enough for 
\T{add1}. Therefore, the data argument is copied to the \T{\$funcall}
component of the result.

\Itm % nov 15
Binary factors: have a different name in drop1 than in coef.
\Arrow Use attr(\$x, "assign") and attr(\$terms,"term.labels")

\Itm
Factors created in the formula statement are difficult to handle
by plresx. They get a flag as \T{is.fac==2}, and fitcomp needs to know
that.
(Consider such strange terms as \T{factor(2*stelle), factor(pmin(a,b))})

\section{The Function \T{regr}}
\Tit{Arguments to regr}
\Itm
\T{family} % and \T{dist}
\T{normal = gaussian, binomial, poisson, gamma, cumlogit, multinomial,
weibull, lognormal, logistic, loglogistic, extreme, t}\\
\note{add cumloglog, ... for polr}
depends on type of response, which may be
\T{numeric, nmatrix, binary, bincount, ordered, factor}
\note{bincount defined by function Bincount}
\T{survival}: default ``family'' is \T{ph}, but others are available,
\T{"weibull"},...\\
Attribute \T{distribution} of y sets default for \T{family}\\
\T{Tobit} entails \T{family="gaussian"} as a default

\Itm
\T{method} !!! changed
\T{lm, rlm, nls, glm, polr, multinom, survreg, coxph}
\note{coxph needs definition of residuals}

\Tit{Value of regr}
Term table:
Coefficients for terms with a single coefficient.
Zero degrees of freedom in some case of interactions: continuous times
factor (obtained in survreg)


%% =================================================================
\section{drop1, add1, step}
\Tit{NAs and subset}
NAs 
\Itm in resppmse \Arrow shorter object\$residual
\Itm in starting model \Arrow same
\Itm in add1 scope 

\Tit{step}
is modified. Why???

\Tit{drop1 and survreg}
\T{object\$df} is \T{length(coef)+1} instead of
\T{length(coef)-intercept}
%% =================================================================
\section{Residuals}
\Tit{Component Effects}
with interactions ?

\Tit{Fuzzy Residuals}
conditional distribution

%% =================================================================
\section{Residual Plots}
\Tit{QQ-plots}
not for glm. adequate distribution! (make sure for Gamma, weibull, ...!)

Conditional: show segments ony if conditional probability in range given by 
\T{condprobrange}

%% =================================================================
\section{Smooths}
Functions:

\code{smoothMM} calls \code{smoothM} calls \code{smooth}, 
which is \code{smoothRegr} by default.
\code{smoothMM} is called from \code{i.plotlws} or, in the case of
resdiduals from smooth (for qq and TAscale), by \code{plot.regr}.
\Itm
\code{smoothRegr} is essentially \code{loess}, with suitable parameter and
error handling. Returns NULL if less than 8 observations are provided
\Itm
\code{smoothMM}: smooth for multiple x and y, needed for multivariate
regression.
Yields a list of lists
\Itm
\code{smoothM}: smooth for multiple y, generating smooths by group. 
Yields a list.

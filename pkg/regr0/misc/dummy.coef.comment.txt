The function  dummy.coef.lm  fails in more complex cases, notably when terms
include variables that are transformed in the  formula  of the model.

r.lm <- lm(Fertility ~ cut(Agriculture, breaks=4) + Infant.Mortality,
             data=swiss)
dummy.coef(r.lm)

Error in model.frame.default(Terms, dummy, na.action = function(x) x,  : 
  factor cut(Agriculture, breaks = 4) has new level (0.9995,1]

The problem is that ii works with  all.vars , which returns untransformed
variables. This is fixed by using  model.frame  instead -- which is needed
later in the function anyway.

The function  dummy.coef.fix  does this.

dummy.coef.fix(r.lm)

Thus,  dummy.coef.lm  should be replaced by  dummt.coef.fix .

In the function, there is a warning
warning("some terms will have NAs due to the limits of the method")
I wonder why this is a "limit' (->limitation) of the method.
If some interaction coefficients are undetermined because the respective
combination of levels is not available, NA is the appropriate result.
Are there other cases?

I have extended the function to include confidence intervals and t-tests
and call the extended function  allcoef .
The latter are what is shown by summary.lm, except that for the (dumy)
variable that is eliminated by the  contrasts . For treatment contrasts,
the added information is trivial (0 with 0 standard error), but for
sum (or weighted sum) contrasts, it is not, and for other contrasts, it may
still recover more useful information. The extended function is called
allcoef .
